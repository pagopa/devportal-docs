# Spontaneous payment via a PSP

With this process, the execution of a spontaneous payment is carried out using the infrastructures provided by the PSP such as banks and ATMs, post offices and Punto Poste locations (postal lockers and pick-up points) bars, newsstands, betting offices, supermarkets, tobacco shops and other participating merchants.

Usually once the user has entered the essential data for the service needed for defining the debt position, they can proceed with the payment.

* The [demandPaymentNotice](../../appendices/primitive.md#demandpaymentnotice) can be used by the PSPs to send the data for the specific service entered by the user in order to receive a response with the information for starting the payment process, this phase is mandatory for the PSPs;
* the [paDemandPaymentNotice](../../appendices/primitive.md#pademandpaymentnotice) is used to request the creditor to create the debt position based on the data transmitted for the specific service, the creditor will send a response with the notice number and the data of the institution receiving the payment;
* with [activatePaymentNotice](../../appendices/primitive.md#activatepaymentnotice) the PSP requests the node to activate the payment at the creditor, making sure to enter in the _qrCode_ the information received in the _response_ to the [demandPaymentNotice](../../appendices/primitive.md#demandpaymentnotice) always in the _qrCode_ tag, this phase is mandatory for the PSPs;
* the request to activate the payment reaches the creditor via [paGetPayment](../../appendices/primitive.md#pagetpayment), unless the creditor is not able to identify the debtor independently and fill in the _debtor_ tag correctly, it is possible to use fictitious data (e.g. "ANONYMOUS");
* the PSP is required to provide the outcome of the payment **within 2sec** with the [sendPaymentOutcome](../../appendices/primitive.md#sendpaymentoutcome), both if the payment was successful (outcome = OK), or if the payment was not successful (outcome = KO);
* By means of the primitive [paSendRT](../../appendices/primitive.md#pasendrt), the _receipt_ is sent to the _n_ creditors involved with the payment only if the payment was made, the _receipt_ is an object generated by the pagoPA platform;
* When the creditor receives the _receipt_, they must close the debt position and consider it fully paid.
