# General operation

The strategic purpose of the pagoPA platform is to facilitate and distribute the use of advanced tools to the benefit of citizens and companies citizens and companies for making payments to the public administration, state-owned companies and public service operators.

The entities that registered with the pagoPA platform in implementation of art. 5 of the CAD (Digital Administration Code) are collectively called creditors (EC).

The registration of all the most important PSPs, Payment Service Providers (banks, electronic currency institutes and payment institutes) with the pagoPA platform makes it possible for their customers to access a wide range of payment tools that is in continuous expansion. For example, holders of Visa, Mastercard, American Express credit cards, holders of PayPal accounts or apps for payments with mobile devices, as well as holders of home banking integrated with the pagoPA platform directly or via the MyBank service can pay with the pagoPA platform.

Registration with the pagoPA platform allows the creditor to benefit from the payment services without having to create a specific relationship with the PSP who provide them to their customers.

The enabling infrastructure that permits the technical dialog between the creditor and the PSP is the pagoPA platform. By means of this platform, the creditor provides the PSP with the data required to provide the payment service and obtains, in a standard manner independently of the utilized payment instrument, the reporting data necessary for account reconciliation, thereby simplifying the back office management processes.
