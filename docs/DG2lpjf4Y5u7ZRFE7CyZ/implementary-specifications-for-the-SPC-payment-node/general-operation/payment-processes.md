* Touch point of the PSP
* IO app <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt="" data-size="line">
* Checkout of PagoPA S.p.A.

The following table shows the features available to users for each channel.

<table><thead><tr><th width="166"></th><th width="150" data-type="checkbox">Creditor frontend</th><th width="150" data-type="checkbox">IO app</th><th width="150" data-type="checkbox">Checkout</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wallet management</td><td>false</td><td>true</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>Payment with cards</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Payment with bank transfer</td><td>true</td><td>false</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Payment without registration</td><td>true</td><td>false</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Payment via a third-party app</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Selection of the PSP</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr></tbody></table>

The table does not have a specific column for the functions available on the PSP channels, as these functions are not managed directly by PagoPA S.p.A. However, the PSP channels can potentially have the following features available:

* wallet management
* payment with cards
* payment with bank transfer
* payment without registration.
