The pagoPA payment system is foreseen by article 5 of CAD (Digital Administration Code) specified by Leg. Decree 82/2005 and by law (pursuant to the combined provisions of art. 2, paragraph 2 of the CAD and art. 15, paragraph 5bis, of Leg. Decree 179/2012) all public administrations must make exclusive use of it, stopping the use of other payment collection systems.

Leg. Decree 179/2016 (G.U.

Leg. Decree 175/2016, in article 2, letter m), defined the concept of a state-owned company. In particular, state-owned companies are defined as those companies in which one or more public administrations exercise powers of control pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code, and specifically:

1. the companies in which another company holds the majority of votes that can be exercised at an ordinary shareholders’ meeting;
2. the companies in which another company holds a sufficient number of votes to exercise a dominating influence at an ordinary shareholders’ meeting;
3. companies that are under a dominating influence of another company by virtue of particular contractual constraints with it.

Article 2359 of the Civil Code specifies that for the purposes of the application of numbers (1) and (2) as specified above, the votes held by subsidiaries, trust companies and third parties shall also be counted, but not the votes held by third parties. The companies over which another company exercises considerable interest are considered associated. Influence is assumed when at least one fifth of the votes can be exercised during the ordinary shareholders’ assembly or one tenth if the company is listed on the stock market. Finally, article 2 of Leg. Decree 175/2016 further specifies that “Control exists also, in application of the law or statutory regulations or shareholders’ agreements, if strategical financial and operational decisions regarding company operations require the unanimous consent of all parties who share control”.
