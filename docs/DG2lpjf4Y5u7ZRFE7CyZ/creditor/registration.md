# Registration

To register with pagoPA as a creditor, the public administrations, public service operators and the state-owned companies must use the registration portal provided by PagoPA S.p.A. (more information is available here [https://docs.pagopa.it/area-riservata/area-riservata/come-aderire](https://docs.pagopa.it/area-riservata/area-riservata/come-aderire) )

Registering a payment service of the creditor with PagoPa does not end with the mere technical integration between the applications of the institution and the payment node of PagoPA. The institution must also ensure that:

* the collection of the services is correctly reconciled in the financial statements (through proper integrations with management software) according to what is required by tax laws specific to the taxonomic code of the collection service.
* the citizens are correctly informed of the new payment option in all contact points in order to maximize awareness about the new method.
* The institution must guarantee, either directly or through a technological partner/intermediary, observance of the SANP guidelines adopted by PagoPA, and their constant monitoring 

When activating the pagoPA system, creditors must use the Reserved portal and the vertical product “pagoPA Backoffice”, which are the instruments made available to all the entities who intervene in the process, with different roles:

* the payment representatives assigned by the creditors;
* the technical representatives (and their delegates) indicated by the creditors, directly connected to the pagoPA platform and the technological partners;
* the operators of the payment platform;
* PagoPA S.p.A.

The payment representative (RP) is the figure appointed by the creditor by means of a delegation by the legal representative to work with the pagoPA system to:

* indicate and manage the connections to the creditor platform;
* appoint the technical representative, if the creditor is connected directly to the platform;
* manage the IBANs of the credit accounts that the creditor wants to use for collecting the amounts due;
* access the trouble-ticketing system made available by PagoPA S.p.A.;
* provide PagoPA S.p.A. with all the data necessary for authorizing use of the trouble-ticketing system made available by PagoPA S.p.A. to other entities belonging to the same institution. 

The same payment representative can be designed by multiple creditors.

The technical representative (RT) is the technical figure of reference for an entity directly connected to the pagoPA platform (creditor or technological partner). Every creditor connection requires a technical representative: the one appointed by the payment representative of the creditor (with a direct connection) or the one indicated by the technological intermediary/partner (in case of an intermediate connection).

The technical representative will be the same for all the institutions that use a technology intermediary or partner that they appointed.

The technical representative will be authorized to access the trouble-ticketing system made available by PagoPA S.p.A. in order to improve and optimize communications between the creditor and the technological partners certified on the pagoPA system and the support service dedicated to it.

The technical representative is also responsible for providing all the data required for authorizing other components of their technical structure to access the trouble-ticketing system made available by PagoPA S.p.A.

## Registration via a technological intermediary <a href="#id-174vkd27dh7y" id="id-174vkd27dh7y"></a>

The payment representative of a creditor that has decided to connect to the platform, delegating the technical activities to a technological intermediary, must:

* register a connection with the preselected technological intermediary with the pagoPA Backoffice;
* activate all credit IBANs

For all the other activities, the creditor will refer to the figure designated by the selected intermediary, without the right of appointment or substitution pursuant to the delegation of the technical activities.

To activate a creditor, that is their connection, the technical representative of the technical intermediary will use a specific pagoPA Backoffice function that will permit them to provide PagoPA S.p.A. with all the requested data. For all the details concerning the activities to perform with the pagoPA Backoffice, refer to the specific user manual.

## Registration using a technological partner <a href="#godgz71r40mh" id="godgz71r40mh"></a>

The payment representative of a creditor that has decided to connect to the platform, delegating the technical activities to a technological partner, must:

* register an intermediate connection with the preselected technological partner with the pagoPA Backoffice;
* activate all credit IBANs of the institution

For all the other activities, the creditor will refer to the figure designated by the selected technological partner, without the right of appointment or substitution pursuant to the delegation of the technical activities.

The start-up process of a creditor who delegated a technological partner is affected by the role of the institution when activating the partner in the pagoPA system.

For a technological partner, in fact, the creditor can represent either the pilot institution, the first creditor for which the partner activates one or more payment models, or a new creditor that they add to those for which the partner is already the intermediary.

In reference to what is stated above, keep in mind that also PagoPA S.p.A. can be qualified as a technological partner (see [Role and responsibilities of PagoPA S.p.A.](../implementary-specifications-for-the-SPC-payment-node/general-operation/roles.md#_rbtjsx52ef6i)).
