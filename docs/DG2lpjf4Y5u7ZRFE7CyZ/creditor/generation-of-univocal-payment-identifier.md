# Generation of the Univocal Payment Identifier

According to what is defined in [paragraph 7.1 of the guidelines](https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2018/07/03/18A04494/sg):

> _“ ..., each creditor attributes an identifier code called a “Univocal Payment Identifier” (IUV) to each collection transaction, which cannot be associated in time with any other collection issued by the same creditor.....”._

The IUV code therefore takes on a fundamental importance 

> _“« ... for the purpose of permitting the payment reconciliation activities by the creditors and the repayment activities by the payment service providers... "_

 thereby representing one of the essential elements on which the pagoPA system is based.

[Paragraph 7.1 of the guidelines](https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2018/07/03/18A04494/sg) also gives the creditors the possibility to

> _“ .... fully or partially delegate the generation of the Univocal Payment Identifier to a third party, making sure that univocality is maintained over time”._

As a result, the generation of the IUV code that remains **univocal** over time is the responsibility of the creditor that, during the creation phase, must keep in mind that this coding must comply with the existing international standards and the guidelines specified in the [SACI](https://docs.pagopa.it/saci) (Implementing specifications of the payment identifier codes).
