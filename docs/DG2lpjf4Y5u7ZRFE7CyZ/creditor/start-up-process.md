# Start-up process

The start-up process of a directly connected creditor requires the fulfillment of some prerequisites that concern the preparation of a test environment, an operating environment and a disaster recovery plan.

The EC, who on the basis of the declared models, wants to make their payment services available on the pagoPA platform, is required to activate:

* a physical external test connection;
* a physical operational connection.

The creditor must also provide all the information required for activating at least one station in an external test environment and at least one station in an operational environment. The definition of the station is the responsibility of the entity directly connected to the platform.

Each physical connection can have a variable number of stations, based on the implemented payment models and the rules/preferences of the directly connected entity. The configuration of a creditor on the platform is completed by associating the payee with at least one of their stations. All of these activities must be performed by the technical representative through the pagoPA Backoffice (for more details, refer to the [User Manual](https://docs.pagopa.it/manuale-back-office-pagopa/)).

The creditor must complete a letter of indemnity for the execution of services subject to the test cases indicated by PagoPa S.p.A. The letter of indemnity must be sent to PagoPA S.p.A. properly filled out and electronically signed by the technical representative of the creditor.

In the letter of indemnity, the technical representative declares that they want to make their services available through the execution of payment operations on the pagoPA platform and guarantees to have successfully performed, both in the external test environment as well as in the operational environment, all the test cases specified by PagoPA S.p.A. as of the date of signing the document.

For the start-up of a creditor, the technical reference person can act as follows:

1. decide whether or not to proceed with the tests required for the external test environment, perhaps using the support of PagoPA S.p.A personnel. If they decide to perform the tests, they must:
   * Provide the credit IBAN to be used in the external test environment;
   * submit a test start date to PagoPA S.p.A., in order to coordinate the specified activities;
2. once the external test IBANs are configured and the tests are completed with the support of PagoPA S.p.A., the technical representative completes the “Test report” and waits for PagoPA S.p.A. to validate it and formally close the test phase;
3. once the testing phase is complete (2), which can also take place also without the direct involvement of PagoPA S.p.A., the technical representative decides whether to proceed with performing the tests required for the operating environment, possibly making use of the personal support of PagoPA S.p.A. If they decide to perform the tests, they must:
   * provide the IBANs of credit to be used in the operating environment (they can use new ones or use IBANs already active for that creditor);
   * once the IBANs are configured in the pre-operational phase and the tests are completed with the support of PagoPA S.p.A., the technical representative completes the “Pre-operational report” and waits for PagoPA S.p.A. to validate it to close the activities;
4. once the pre-operational phase is complete, which can take place also without the direct involvement of PagoPA S.p.A., the technical representative completes the letter of indemnity and waits for PagoPA S.p.A. to validate it and formally close the activation of the creditor on the platform;
5. PagoPA S.p.A. authorizes the creditor for operation, requesting the creditor’s payment representative to activate at least one IBAN of credit on the pagoPA Backoffice if at least one is not yet already present.
