# Integration methods

PagoPA makes two methods for integration with the pagoPA platform available to the concerned entities (that is the technological intermediaries, technological partners and creditors):

* [integration-via-asynchronous-api.md](integration-via-asynchronous-api.md "mention")
* [integration-via-synchronous-api.md](integration-via-synchronous-api.md "mention")

Every concerned entity is able to select the integration method best suited to their configuration. The technical intermediaries, technological partners and the creditors who use the integration via synchronous API are required to assign all the managed debt positions to the _Centralized Notice Archive_ (ACA).  

The provision of these integration methods lies within the scope of PagoPAâ€™s obligations deriving from the requirement pursuant to ex art. 146 T.U.B. of monitoring by the Banca d'Italia for the purposes of ensuring the measures of operational continuity that must be adopted by operators of payment systems and by critical suppliers of infrastructures or technical services for payment systems and instrumental technological or network structures. 

For technical questions related to the implementation of pagoPA, it is possible to open a support case at GitHub [https://github.com/pagopa/pagopa-api/issues](https://github.com/pagopa/pagopa-api/issues)
