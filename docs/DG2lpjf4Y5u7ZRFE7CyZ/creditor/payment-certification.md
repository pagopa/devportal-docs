# Payment certification

Every payment transaction is certified with the generation (and delivery) to the creditor of a _receipt_ that is generated by the platform following the validation performed by PagoPA of the information received from the concerned entities (EC and PSP).

The creditor must make the _receipt_ available upon request of the end user, both as an electronic copy as well as an analogue copy of it.

The analogue copies of it must contain not only the logo of the pagoPA system but also the following information:

* _transaction date and time:_ this refers to the date and time in which the end user started the payment transaction on the platform and is used for purposes of releasing the user;
* _Application date:_ this refers to the date on which the payment was registered in the PSP selected for the payment and determines the business day (see the guidelines and relative definition in the SACI) on which the payment transaction takes place;
* fiscal code of the creditor (_fiscalCodePA_)
* name of the creditor (_companyName_)
* univocal payment identifier, univocal identifier assigned to the creditor (_creditorReferenceId_)
* PSP identifier (at least one company name and fiscal code)
* univocal payment number (_paymentToken_)
* transaction amount (_totalAmount_)
* payment reason (_paymentDescription_)
