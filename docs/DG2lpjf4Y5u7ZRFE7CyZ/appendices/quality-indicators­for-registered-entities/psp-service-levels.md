## Managing the PSP timeouts

The timeout represents a predetermined period of time after which a given operation is considered concluded by the node.

The following table shows, for each primitive, the maximum times the node waits for the response from the PSP, remembering however that every PSP is required to respect the service levels indicated in the previous paragraph.
