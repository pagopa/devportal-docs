* A prerequisite for the payment is that the debt position has been previously created by the EC and communicated to the POS with its fundamental data, _qrCode_ and _amount_;
* the _qrCode_ must be exchanged with the PSP so that the latter can proceed with the activation;
* with [activatePaymentNotice](primitive.md#activatepaymentnotice) the PSP requests the node to activate the payment at the EC, this phase is mandatory for the PSPs; to correctly identify the type of payment in the _touchPoint_ tag the "POS" value must be entered;
* The request to activate the payment reaches the creditor by means of [paGetPayment](primitive.md#pagetpayment);
* the activation confirmation is forwarded to the POS which, at this point, permits the payment and sends its result to the PSP;
* The PSP is OBLIGATED to provide the payment result in real time with the [sendPaymentOutcome](primitive.md#sendpaymentoutcome), therefore as soon as the end user has paid or confirmed on the PSP touchpoint, and in any case before the expiration of the token, both in case of a successful payment (outcome = OK), as well as in case of an unsuccessful payment (outcome = KO);
* By means of the primitive [paSendRT](primitive.md#pasendrt), the _receipt_ is sent to the _n_ creditors involved with the payment only if the payment was made, the _receipt_ is an object generated by the pagoPA platform;
* When the creditor receives the _receipt_, they must close the debt position and consider it fully paid.
