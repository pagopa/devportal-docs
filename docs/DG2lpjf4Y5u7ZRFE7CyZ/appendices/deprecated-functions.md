## Counterparty table

The structure of the counterparty table is deprecated as the information it contains no longer needs to be exchanged due to the evolution of the pagoPA platform.

## Credit account disclosure

The information related to accounts to be credited will be managed using the new functions provided by the PagoPA Backoffice. 

{% hint style="info" %} The _counterparty table_ and the _credit account disclosure_ has been replaced by new APIs in the pagoPA BackOffice.
