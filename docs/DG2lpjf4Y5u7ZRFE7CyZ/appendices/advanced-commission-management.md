# Advanced commission management

PagoPA S.p.A has implemented this service that introduces a rules engine that acts as a converter for all of the platform’s payment operations, making it possible for the PSP to create ad hoc commission package for specific payments, guaranteeing greater flexibility based on

* different commissions with respect to the EC
* touchpoint
* taxonomy of the debt position
* amount
* selected payment tool
* period

every EC has the possibility, for each commission package, to set the fee they charge and also associate it with certain taxonomies.

This service is an alternative to the use of the **Information Data Catalog.**

## Marketplace

This is the tool that allows the ECs to participate in certain packages (public or private) exposed by the PSPs or to complete global packages with additional attributes (their commissions and taxonomy).

Each PSP can define 3 types of commission packages

* global → available for the payments of any EC;
* public → available only for payments of the ECs who activated an “agreement” via the marketplace;
* private → available only for payments of the ECs who activated an “agreement” via the marketplace upon invitation of the PSP;
