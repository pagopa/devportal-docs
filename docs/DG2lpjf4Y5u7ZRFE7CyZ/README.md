**Annex B to the "Guidelines for making electronic payments to public administrations and public service providers" published by PagoPA SpA - version 3.7.1 - April 2024**

The electronic payment systems for the Public Administration, the pagoPA system, guarantees that end users can make electronic payments to the Public administration, state-owned companies and Public Service Operators in a safe, reliable and simple manner with fully transparent commission costs.

The introduction of the pagoPA platform provides benefits to citizens, the Public administration, Payment Service Providers and for the entire country system:

  * transparency and lower costs;
  * possibility to use public services in a more direct manner;
  * simplification of the payment process that makes it possible to use a greater number of possible channels and services;
  * standardization of the user experiences for payments to the Public administration, state-owned companies and Public Service Operators;
  * standardization of payment notice communications;
* benefits for the Public administration
  * reduction in collection times through the direct credit of amounts to their accounts by the day following the payment;
  * reduction in cash management costs;
  * improvement in the efficiency of managing collections through automatic reconciliation;
  * elimination of the need to call for tenders for the procurement of collection services, resulting in reduced inefficiencies and commission costs not in line with market conditions;
  * reduction in costs and times for developing online applications (reuse of solutions);
  * elimination of the need for multiple collection agreements;
  * greater automatic checks to prevent double payments and the resulting reimbursement procedures;
* benefits for the Payment Service Providers (PSP)
  * elimination of the need for multiple agreements with the PAs;
  * reduction in cash management costs;
  * improvement in the provided services;
  * increased customer loyalty;

  * complete compliance with the PSD2 standards;
  * incentives for the use of electronic payments on a national level for transactions with the Public administration that make it possible to stimulate the market and promote increased competition among payment services and, as a result, a leveling of commissions.

The pagoPA platform was established by the Agency for Digital Italy (AgID) in implementation of art. 5 of the CAD (Digital Administration Code), which specifies that in order to implement what is required by the article in question, "the President of the Council of Ministers must provide a technical platform, through the public connectivity system, for interconnection and interoperability between Public administrations and authorized payment service providers". Article 5 of the CAD also assigned. upon consultation with the Banca d’Italia, the Agency for Digital Italy with the task of defining the guidelines for the actuation of article 5 of CAD and for the specification of the payment identifier codes and the methods with which the payment service operators provide the institution with information regarding the payment itself.

[Leg. Decree 135/2018](https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2018/12/14/18G00163/sg) transferred the management of the pagoPA platform, as well as the tasks related to this platform performed by the Agency for Digital Italy to the President of the Council and ordered the establishment of a state-owned limited company that operates under the guidance of the President of the Council, such as PagoPA SpA.
