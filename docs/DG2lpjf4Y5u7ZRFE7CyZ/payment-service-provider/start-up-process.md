# Start-up process

## Activation of a PSP that connects directly to the Node <a href="#invedfdp2run" id="invedfdp2run"></a>

The representative of the PSP who wants to be activated on the pagoPA system through a direct connection to the platform must identify the most suitable solution for establishing a physical connection suitable for guaranteeing the service levels required by PagoPA S.p.A. and also prepare a disaster recovery plan. The process for the start-up of the PSP that connects directly to the payment platform requires the following requirements to be satisfied:

* the activation of a physical connection with the platform's external test environment;
* the activation of a physical connection with the platform's operational environment.

Once the connections have been established, the representative of the PSP can start the process as follows:

1. Complete the Information Data Catalog to be used in the external test environment and, together with it, provide PagoPA S.p.A. with all the information necessary for completing the configuration of the payment channels indicated in the catalog;
2. proceed with the execution of the required tests in the external test environment, with or without the support of PagoPA S.p.A. personnel for the formal validation of the results of the use cases indicated in the Test Plan (provided by PagoPA S.p.A. on its corporate website);
3. once the external test phase is complete, the PSP representative completes the Information Data Catalog and, together with it, provides PagoPA S.p.A. with all the information required for completing the configuration of the payment channels in the operational environment;
4. proceed with the execution of the required tests in this environment, with or without the support of PagoPA S.p.A. personnel for the formal validation of the results of the use cases indicated in the Test Plan;
5. provide PagoPA S.p.A. with the information concerning the “operational workgroup”.

In order to complete the activation process, the PSP representative completes the letter of indemnity for the execution of the services subject to the test cases and delivers it to PagoPA S.p.A. properly signed. By delivering the letter of indemnity, the representative guarantees to have successfully performed all the test cases required by PagoPA S.p.A., both in the external test environment and in the operational environment, as of the date of signing the document itself.

## Activation of a PSP that offers the CBILL service <a href="#y4fovt50y64o" id="y4fovt50y64o"></a>

The PSPs that want to offer end customers the CBILL service (of the CBI consortium - Customer to Business Interaction) on the pagoPA system will have the activation procedure facilitates as the CBI consortium takes on the role of the Technical Intermediary and PSP is only responsible for providing PagoPA S.p.A. with the “Information Data Catalog” together with all the information related to the CBILL payment channel.

## Activation of an intermediate PSP <a href="#smow7ueaopam" id="smow7ueaopam"></a>

The registered PSPs that want to use the pagoPA system indirectly can use intermediaries to whom they delegate the performance of all technical activities. For these activities, the PSP “intermediary” will refer to the technical figure designated by the selected technical intermediary, without the right of appointment or substitution pursuant to the delegation of the technical activities.
