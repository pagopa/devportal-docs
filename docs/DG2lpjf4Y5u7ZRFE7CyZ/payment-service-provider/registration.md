To register with the pagoPA system, the representative of the PSP must have downloaded the form related to the agreement model from the Payment Service Provider section of the PagoPA S.p.A. website, sign it electronically and sent it via pec (certified email) to: [accordipsp@pec.pagopa.it](mailto:accordipsp@pec.pagopa.it)

For any clarification about the procedure for the registration of a PSP, it is possible to consult the FAQs published on the PagoPA S.p.A. website, or write to the address [legal@pagopa.it](mailto:legal@pagopa.it).
