# Technological intermediary

## Who can be a technological intermediary?

As provided by the operating model, **both the creditors as well as the payment service providers can benefit when registering with pagoPA from the interfacing activities already implemented by other registered entities ( Technological intermediaries**). A technological intermediary is an entity that offers, after registering with the pagoPA platform, services to others for the connection and exchange of flows with the pagoPA platform, in full compliance with the [guidelines](https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2018/07/03/18A04494/sg) and the relative technical standards; therefore only entities who have registered with the payments-SPC node can perform the role of technological intermediary.

## How can a PSP make use of an intermediary?

As provided by art. 6, paragraph 2 of the standard contract, **the single PSP can indicate a technological intermediary for each payment service they offer.** The PSP provides all the necessary information in the information data catalog. Therefore, for the selection of an intermediary, the PSP must provide this information to PagoPA S.p.A. by sending a pec (certified email) to [accordipsp@pec.pagopa.it](mailto:accordipsp%40pec.pagopa.it).
