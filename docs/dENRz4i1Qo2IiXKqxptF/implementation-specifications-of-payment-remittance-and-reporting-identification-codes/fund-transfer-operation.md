# Fund transfer operation

For the fund transfer operation to each Creditor, the PSP only uses the SEPA Credit Transfer instrument. The transfer operations are timed on each operating day of the Public Connectivity System Payment Node as better specified in the next paragraph. Consistent with Articles 15 and 20 of Legislative Decree No. 11/2010, the payer's PSP is required to remit the collected amounts in a cumulative mode.

Therefore, the PSP is required to make one, and only one, transfer that contains the cumulative amount of all and only the payment transactions sent in the Reporting Flow indicated in the _Flowidentifier_ attribute of the _Remittance Information_ field of the SCT scheme.. The reconciliation and squaring off methods are described in the [reconciliation-of-remittance-flow.md](reconciliation-of-remittance-flow.md "mention").

The envisaged SEPA Credit Transfer templates should be used for the execution of the transaction (see [SEPA Credit Transfer rulebook](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/what-we-do/sepa-payment-schemes/sepa-credit-transfer/sepa-credit-transfer-rulebook-and) published by EPC ).

Table 3 shows how to assign values to the attributes of an SCT template:

#### Table 3 - Attribution of values to SCT template

Legend:

* \<prog>: is a one-digit progressive number between 0 and 9, with
  * 0 -> ordinary SCT;
  * 1-9 -> supplementary SCTs in the day as a result of technical anomalies;
* \<Amount>: total SCT amount, i.e. the sum of the individual transaction amounts entered in the associated Reporting Flow, identifiable by \<FlowIdentifier>;
* \<IBAN of Beneficiary>: The PSP draws this data from the executed payment requests;
* \<Beneficiary Fiscal Code>: The PSP draws this data from the executed payment requests;
* \<FlowIdentifier>: specifies the data element related to the FlowIdentifier information present in the Reporting Flow described in the following [reporting-flow.md](reporting-flow.md "mention");
* \<EndToEndID>: reference assigned by the PSP to the fund transfer operation.

Please note:

* a single SCT must be prepared for each RF, only in case of technical anomalies can supplementary SCTs be executed;
* specific SCTs may not be executed for each individual payment transaction;
* in order to perform automatic reconciliation of the payment the information of attribute AT-05 was composed according to the structure proposed by the European Association of Corporate Treasurers (EACT) in the document [EACT FORMATTING RULES OF SEPA “UNSTRUCTURED” 140 CHRS FIELD FOR REMITTANCE INFORMATION](https://eact.eu/Core/Documents/Wordpress_Old/docs/EACT_Standard_for_Remittance_Info.pdf) and aimed at the automated processing of information between business partners. In particular, the strings "/PUR/", "/TXT/" and "/URI/" are constant tags whose meaning is defined by the EACT standard
  * **PUR** _purpose of payment, coded_
  * **TXT** _free text, to be used in combination with other structured elements_
  * **URI** _identification of a Remittance Advice which is sent separately_

## Operating day and sending of the SEPA Credit Transfer

Consistent with the provisions of Article 20 of Legislative Decree No. 11/2010, the payer's PSP shall ensure that the amount of the transaction is credited to the Creditor's account by the end of the operating day following the day indicated in the relevant telematic receipt.

In order to ensure the uniform application of the maximum execution time of transactions and also taking into account the different operating models adopted by the PSPs, regardless of the end of the operating day established by each PSP, the end of the operating day for the receipt of payment transactions to be made through the Payments Node is generally established for each PSP at 1:00 p.m. (the so-called "Payments Node operating day"), the time indicated refers to the Italian time in effect at the time of the payment transaction and the Italian calendar applies.

Specifically, all transactions arising from a Payment Request where D day is indicated in conjunction with a time up to and including 1:00 p.m. belong to the Public Connectivity System Payment Node operating day (D), while all transactions arising from a Payment Request where D day is indicated but in conjunction with a time from 1:01 p.m. until 1:00 p.m. of the next business day belong to the next Public Connectivity System Payment Node operating day (D+1). 

The date and time specified in the telematic receipt (_paymentDateTime_ element of the _receipt)_, is decisive for the purpose of fulfilling the end user's obligation to the Creditor, regardless of the actual time or operating day at/on which the payment is credited to the Creditor.

From the expiration of the deadline for the execution of the credit to the Creditor’s account of the amount of the payment transaction, legal interest on arrears equal to the ECB rate increased by eight percentage points shall accrue.

In the event that the PSP, for reasons attributable to it, does not credit the amount of the transaction to the Creditor’s account by the end of the operating day of the Public Connectivity System Payment Node following that of the payment (the date of the crediting day is explicit in the _transferDate_ field of the _receipt)_, without prejudice to the debiting of default interest in the amount referred to above, the PSP will also be liable for any damage caused to the Creditor and/or the end user as a result of the delay in crediting the amount of the transaction, including damages related to the application of sanctions against the Creditor established by specific reference legislation. For example, for Creditors performing the collection service, the penalties set forth in Article 47 of Legislative Decree No. 112 of April 13, 1999, should be noted.

## Rejection of the SEPA Credit Transfer

If the SEPA Credit Transfer is returned with a REJECT message to the PSP that sent it, the PSP shall immediately notify the pagoPA system management operational service through the channels made available, indicating the information in Table 4.
