# Preamble

**Annex A to the "Guidelines for making electronic payments to public administrations and public service providers" published by PagoPA SpA - version 3.2.1 - April 2024**

Since the enactment of Decree-Law No. 179 of October 18, 2012, converted, with amendments, by Law No. 221 of December 17, 2012, important changes have been introduced to Article 5 of the CAD (Making payments by electronic means). 

All the changes made over time have been aimed at encouraging the closing of the "digital divide" and the development of the use of e-cash also in payments to public administrations and other public interest entities through the provision of a centralized platform for the execution of public payments. 

In order to give practical implementation to Article 5 of the CAD, the Agency for Digital Italy, having consulted the Bank of Italy, as punctually provided for in paragraph 4 of the same Article 5 of the CAD, issued and published the document (hereinafter, Guidelines) which, in illustrating the methods to be adopted for the execution of said payments, refers to specific technical documents.

These Implementation Specifications constitute **Annex A** to the aforementioned Guidelines and should be used in conjunction with the latter, as well as with **Annex B (SANP)**, documents to which reference is made for all items and topics not specifically indicated herein.

In what follows, we will use the term **“Creditors”** to refer to public administrations, publicly controlled companies or public service providers that, in various capacities, are creditors of amounts to end users.

As stated in the aforementioned Guidelines, these specifications refer to the international SEPA standards using the [UNIFI ISO 20022](http://www.iso20022.org/) format.
