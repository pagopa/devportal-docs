# Get Subscriptions Feed

{% hint style="info" %} This mode is reserved to central institutions or institutions on a national level.  
[**Discover how to request authorization ->** ](../../enabling/subscription-feed.md) {% endhint %}

## Description

The API [get-subscriptions-feed.md](get-subscriptions-feed.md "mention") makes it possible to download the _hashes_ of the fiscal codes of the citizens registered/deregistered to service for a specific date (UTC-YYYY-MM-DD). 

The purpose of the _subscription feed_ is to provide the central institutions with a tool to minimize phone calls to the IO infrastructure by means of a filter created by the institution itself. 

The _subscription feed_ information **is updated as of the previous day**. For the creation of the _subscription feed_, you must query the service for each day starting from 03/24/2020 up to the current date and save the data in your infrastructure. 

{% hint style="danger" %} In no case is it possible to request the fiscal code in an unencoded manner. {% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %} For technical details on how to encode fiscal codes of your system to be able to compare them with those returned from the _subscription feed_, expand the following section. {% endhint %}
