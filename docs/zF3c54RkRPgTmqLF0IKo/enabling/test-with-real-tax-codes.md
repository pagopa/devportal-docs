# Test with real fiscal codes

To be able to send messages to real fiscal codes that belong to the users, you must contact the system administrators at the email address [onboarding@io.italia.it](mailto:onboarding@io.italia.it) specifying:

<details>
<summary>If you are using the Developer Portal</summary>
* Email of the user registered with the developer portal
* service (or subscription) id
* fiscal codes to enable for receiving push notifications and messages in the IO app

</details>
<details>
<summary>If you are using the Reserved Area</summary>
* Fiscal code of the user of the Reserved Area
* service (or subscription) id
* fiscal codes to enable for receiving push notifications and messages in the IO app

</details>
The authorization process requires sending a **message in app containing a univocal verification code** to each individual identified by the indicated fiscal codes. To complete the authorization, each recipient must send back the received verification code as indicated in the message.
