<summary><strong>What is an aggregator?</strong></summary>
Institutions can join IO as aggregators of other service providers.

_Example: A region joins IO, aggregating the registration relationship for all the local institutions in the territory of reference, making the regional in-house company available for managing the technological integration of all local institutions._

The aggregation relationship among the service providers is regulated by agreements (including the cooperation agreements specified in art. 15 of Law 241/1990) and by the administrative documents necessary to provide the aggregator with the powers and assignments necessary to sign the standard contract also on behalf and to the benefit of the aggregated parties, accepting the observance of the obligations contained therein by the aggregated parties.

In this way, the aggregator guarantees that the obligations contained in the standard contract will be observed by the aggregated parties.

The aggregators must list all the institutions they represent for the purpose of registration with IO, via attachment 3 of the [standard contract](https://io.italia.it/assets/download/it/accordo-di-adesione-IO-2.4.zip), where they must communicate the complete list of institutions, indicating: name of the represented institution, address, fiscal code/vat no. and IPA (Public Administration Index) code.

<mark style="color:red;">**Important!**</mark>

If an institution wants to independently subscribe to other services (in addition to those made available by the aggregator), they must follow the complete onboarding procedure and sign the standard contract [in the Reserved Area.](adesione-tramite-larea-riservata.md).

The aggregator may **only** provide the services for which they were appointed by the aggregated institution, but **may not** replace the institution with respect to the services for which they did not receive a mandate.
