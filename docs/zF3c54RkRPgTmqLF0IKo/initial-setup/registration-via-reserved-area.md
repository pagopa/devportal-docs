# Registration via the Reserved Area

Before being able to use the IO API, your institution must first have an active basic registration. If it is not registered, the first step is to perform the [_IO app onboarding process_](https://selfcare.pagopa.it/onboarding/prod-io) in the Reserved Area.

During the registration process, enter the data for:

1. a **legal representative** of the institution;
2. one or more **administrators**, that is the people who will have all the permissions for that product.

Once all the data has been entered, the Reserved Area **will send a contract** to the PEC (certified email) of the requesting institution. It must be **signed digitally** by the legal representative and **loaded** in the Reserved Area using the _magic link_ indicated in the PEC.
