# Import of services in the Reserved Area

### What is the Reserved Area

The [Reserved Area](https://www.pagopa.it/it/area-riservata/) is the web portal dedicated to all institutions that collaborate with PagoPA.

The new Reserved Area is also the back-office where institutions create their IO services and manage the relative API keys, in replacement of the previous [IO Developer Portal](https://developer.io.italia.it/).

The Developer Portal is still functioning, but will be discontinued in the upcoming months in favor of the back office that can be accessed from the **[Reserved Area](https://www.pagopa.it/it/self-care/). The migration process will be gradual and institutions will have all the time they need to switch to the new portal.

All the institutions will be invited by means of a direct communication, at different times, to switch to the [Reserved Area](https://www.pagopa.it/it/area-riservata/). Once the institutions have entered the Reserved Area, they can start importing their services from the old Developer Portal.

The import consists in moving the services from the old Developer Portal to the new back-office, in order to be **transferred to the institution of reference** according to the new method in the Reserved Area.

Therefore the services will not be visible only to the delegate that created them but also to all the users that work for the institution.

The services will be moved to the new back-office, once the import is started: if the delegate accesses the developer portal with the old credentials, they will not find their services.
