A service on IO is the **digital version** or the **extension of an already digitalized service** provided by an institution â€“ public, private, central or local â€“ and targeted toward one or more groups of citizens.

Here are the steps to follow to create a service.

Follow the instructions on how to "[Create a new service](creare-un-servizio.md)"

<details>
<summary><mark style="color:blue;">Step 3</mark>- Test the service</summary>
Before publishing a service in app, view the service tab in app to make sure everything is correct. To do so, read [try-a-service-being-tested.md](provare-un-servizio-in-test.md "mention")

<details>
<summary><mark style="color:blue;">Step 4</mark>- Send a test message</summary>
If you want, you can send a test message. To learn more about messages and how to send text messages, read how to [send-a-message ](../inviare-un-messaggio/ "mention") and send [test-messages.md](../inviare-un-messaggio/messaggi-di-test.md "mention")

</details>
<details>
<summary><mark style="color:blue;">Step 5</mark>- Request a service review</summary>
If everything is ready [submit the service for evaluation](revisione-del-servizio.md) by PagoPA. If the service is evaluated positively, it will be **approved**, otherwise it will be **rejected** with a reason, which will be communicated to you so you can change it and submit it again.

</details>
<details>
<summary><mark style="color:blue;">Step 6</mark>- Publish the service</summary>
If you did not request automatic publishing during review, once it is approved you can [make the service visible](visibilita-del-servizio.md) independently.
