# Service visibility

When the service is approved, you can manage its visibility in the IO app.

{% hint style="info" %} An **approved** service can be **published** (and therefore made _public in the IO app)_ or **unpublished** (and therefore made _private in the IO app_) whenever you want. {% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %} Remember, the review process must be repeated each time you want to make a change to the service tab. {% endhint %}

### **Publish a service in the IO app**

#### Via the Developer Portal

Each service for which [review is requested](service-review.md) via Developer Portal is activated automatically.

#### Via the Reserved Area

Each service for which [review is requested](service-review.md) via the Reserved Area is activated automatically. 

#### Via API

Two methods are available:

* When you are sending a review request you can ask for automatic publication and in the case of approval it will be published automatically.
* You can use the '[specific API`service release`](../../api-and-specifications/api-services/manage-service-release.md) to publish an approved service.
