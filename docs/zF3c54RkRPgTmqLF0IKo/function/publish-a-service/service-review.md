# Service review

When the service tag is complete and compliant with the [Service manual](https://app.gitbook.com/o/KXYtsf32WSKm6ga638R3/s/zcLztiq5qDSVw9rRjW7p/), you can sent a request for review. 

If the service is **approved**, the institution can proceed with publishing (automatically if this was specified in the review request sent via API). If **rejected**, you will be informed of the reason, which will allow you to make the necessary changes to submit it again for evaluation.
