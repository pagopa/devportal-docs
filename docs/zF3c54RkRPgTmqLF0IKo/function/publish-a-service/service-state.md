# Service status

### Statuses

All the statuses a service can have, how to consult them and how they can change are indicated here.

<details>
<summary>Draft</summary>
**Draft:** a service that must still be modified or completed.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Submitted</summary>
**Under review**: a service for which a review was requested.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Rejected</summary>
**Changes requested**: a service that was evaluated by PagoPA S.p.A and that needs corrections or additions. It must therefore be modified and then submitted for a new review.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Approved</summary>
**Active:** a service that was positively evaluated by PagoPA S.p.A. Only approved services can be published on IO. 

If an approved service is modified, a new version of the service is generated. The version that was approved remains available for publication until another version has been positively reviewed and has the `approved` status.

Therefore you will have a maximum of two versions of the service:

* A service that is `approved`, `published` or `unpublished`
* A service that is `draft`, `submitted` or `rejected`

</details>
<details>
<summary>Published</summary>
**Published:** a service that has been approved and made visible on IO.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Unpublished</summary>
**Unpublished:** a service that has been approved but is not yet visible on IO.
