# The service catalog of the municipalities

The [service catalog of the municipalities](https://docs.pagopa.it/v1.0-catalogo-dei-servizi/) on IO is a list created considering the services that are most important, significant and frequent in the IO app and **is intended for municipalities and their technological partners**. 

Each service catalog for municipality services is comprised of:

* A topic, that is a theme to which the service refers. This item does not need to be specified on the service tab;
* The **name of the service**, which responds to the attribute `service_name` or ”Service name”;
* The **description of the service**, which responds to the attribute `description` or "Description”.

### Why use it? 

If your institution choses the services to publish among those in the catalog: 

* They will have the service tab available that the institution can republish without any changes or after eliminating one or more points after “Via IO"; 
* The service will be approved automatically.

{% hint style="info" %} If the institution prefers publishing a service that is not included in the catalog, they can do so. The service will be submitted to a **manual check** and will be evaluated according to what is written in this manual. Therefore, approval is not ensured — unlike when selecting a service already in the catalog. {% endhint %}
