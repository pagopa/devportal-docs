# When should a message be sent?

The reception of a message in a user device triggers a push notification. Each user:

* **can decide whether to receive a push notification from IO** for each message that is successfully sent from all active services. This decision is made when accessing the app for the first time and can be changed at any moment in the preferences in your device;
* **receive or "turn off” the push notifications for a specific service**, by changing the settings directly on the service tab.

**IO does not delay the sending of messages**

IO cannot delay the sending of a message and the relative push notification. It is not possible to know the content of the messages, which could be urgent – just think of the millions of COVID-19 green certificates issued by pharmacies or the hubs open at night. 

If the sending of the message is controlled by automatic triggers, we recommend checking the sending time. If the message concerns millions of users, PagoPA cannot control the time slot it will be sent.

Unfortunately it is not possible to never disturb the citizens as it is not possible to control their current conditions. For this reason, the operating systems have functions that allow users to **adapt the behavior of their device** to their needs (e.g. “I am abroad”, “I work at night and sleep during the day”, “I do not want to be disturbed when I am working").

For these reasons, **it is important to make sure the sent messages are**:

* **timely,** they arrive at the best moment possible, based on their purpose;
* **useful,** they always provide the user with an advantage, even if only informational;
* **clear**, they require the minimum cognitive effort possible;
* **self-consistent**, it is not necessary to find information on other channels in order to understand them.
