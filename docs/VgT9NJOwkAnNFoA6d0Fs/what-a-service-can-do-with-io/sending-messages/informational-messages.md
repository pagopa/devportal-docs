**`Title`**  
`New digital TV: resynchronize channels or decoder`

**`Message`**  
`From today, all television channels from national broadcasters will be visible in high quality. To continue viewing your preferred programs, you must resynchronize your television or decoder.`

`If you are not able to see the channels after resynchronization, this probably means that your television or decoder are not compatible with the new technology. To replace them, you can request the bonuses provided by the Ministry of Economic Development.`  
  
`For more information go to the `[`website dedicated to the initiative`](https://nuovatvdigitale.mise.gov.it/)`or call 06 87 800 262.`

**In this case, the message:**

✅ is self-consistent and conversational;

**`Title`**  
`Result of the request`

**`Message`**  
`Dear user,`

`The result of your request to sign up for the language course is online.`

**In this case, the message:**

❌ it is not self-consistent because it does not directly provide the result in the message when it could do so;

❌ alternatively it does not provide a link with which the user can view the result;

❌ it uses “dear user”: is very generic and distant: this should be avoided;

❌ the tone/language used with the citizens is formal instead of informal.
