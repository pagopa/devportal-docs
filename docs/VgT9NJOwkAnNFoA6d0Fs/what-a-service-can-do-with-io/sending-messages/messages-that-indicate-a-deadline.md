# Messages that indicate a deadline

These messages contain a **deadline or a reminder**, such as a reminder for the expiration date of a document to be renewed or the deadline for requesting a bonus. For this type of message, use the `due_date`field in the message payload. The data format supported by the system is UTC (ISO 8601).

In addition to the manual conversion option, there are some websites that **automatically convert** dates into the desired format, such as the [DenCode Converter](https://dencode.com/date/iso8601) or [Timestamp Converter](https://www.timestamp-converter.com/). 

{% hint style="warning" %} **Attention to the set date**

If the expiration date does not have a specific time, usually it refers to the end of the day.

**Example:**

✅ January 12 (23:59:59) --> the user can pay by January 12

❌ January 12 (00:00:01) --> the user can pay by January 11 {% endhint %}
