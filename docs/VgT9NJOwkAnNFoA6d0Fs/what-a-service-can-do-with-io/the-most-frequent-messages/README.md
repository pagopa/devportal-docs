# The most frequent messages

The most frequent messages are templates the Institution can start from to configure the messages to be sent via their services on IO.

If you have not already done so, we encourage you to check out the [Most Frequently Used Service Templates](../../catalog-of-services-and-models/the-most-frequent-service-models.md) where you will find a wide selection of service templates and all the related messages you can send on IO. 

{% hint style="warning" %} **A message to be customized**

The details of these messages vary greatly among institutions. We recommend using the message texts as a starting point for personalizing the communication. 

The messages reported in this section are an example that is not binding for the institution and for which the Company declines all liability, as they serve only by way of example. {% endhint %}

## Why use them? 

With the Frequently Used Message Templates you can:

* have at your disposal basic messages created by us, which you can customize according to your specific needs; 
* explore the messages you could send based on the intended function, such as booking an appointment or paying a notice;
* See how to make the most of the IO app's capabilities

{% hint style="info" %} If you prefer not to use one of the templates suggested within the section, you can always proceed by creating a message from scratch. {% endhint %}

## How to use the most frequent messages

In order to use the message templates, you can simply copy the text contained within the message.

When you find texts <mark style="color:purple;">{between single curly brackets and highlighted in purple},</mark> remember that these are _placeholders_ **to be replaced**.

> Example: Payment notice <mark style="color:purple;">{object}</mark> 

Texts <mark style="color:green;">//between double slashes and highlighted in green // </mark>are comments **to be removed**.

> Example: Payment notice <mark style="color:green;">//here I write a comment</mark>

The texts <mark style="color:orange;">{{{between triple curly brackets and highlighted in orange}}}</mark> are suggestions **that you can decide whether to remove or keep**.

> Example: If you have already paid the notice <mark style="color:orange;">{{{or if you have applied for a direct debit on a current account, }}}</mark>please ignore this message.
