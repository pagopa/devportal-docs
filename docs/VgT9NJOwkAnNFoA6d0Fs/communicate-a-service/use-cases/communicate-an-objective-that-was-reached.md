# Communicate an objective that was reached

When a service is going particularly well or if its use has reached some digitalization objectives that the institution set for itself, it is a good ideal to communicate it publicly to:

* **be seen as an innovative institution**;
* further promote use of the service, **emphasizing its benefits for citizens**;
* **announce**, if applicable, **upcoming services** that will be made available on IO.

In this case, we suggest:

1. **write new articles** on the institutional website;
2. **launch it on the institution's social media**;
3. publish a **press release** and launch it via local media.

The [**Communication kit for institutions**](https://docs.pagopa.it/kit-di-comunicazione-per-gli-enti/) contains graphic copies and social content to customize to create an informational campaign on IO.
