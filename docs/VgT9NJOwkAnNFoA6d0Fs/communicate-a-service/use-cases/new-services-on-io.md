# New services on IO

The institution has signed a contract to join and has published one more services on IO for the first time? This is a unique occasion to communicate **an important and significant event** to citizens. There are many aspects to announce:

* **what** the new services are and what they do;
* **to whom are they directed**;
* **how to use them**, requesting people to **download the app** and therefore increase the user base;
* **show users you are an innovative institution**, up to date and close to the needs of people. 

In this case, we suggest:

1. **sending a message with IO** to communicate to those who already have the app that the institution is now part of the project and which services they offer.

**Important**

This type of communication can be used _once_, or in any case very rarely, possibly only when the institution joins IO for the first time, and not every time a new service is added in the app - unless this is relevant on a national scale.

There are many institutions on IO: the risk is to overwhelm citizens with welcome messages and generate a perceived spam effect.

2\. **use all the most important channels**, both digital and analog, to engage citizens that do not have IO: a news article on the website, a press release to send to newspapers, the institutional accounts on social media with the most followers, brochures or posters to hang in public spaces.

The [**Communication kit for institutions**](https://docs.pagopa.it/kit-di-comunicazione-per-gli-enti/) contains graphic copies and social content to customize to create an informational campaign on IO.
