# 3️⃣ How is the objective reached?

Once the service is defined, you have to ask yourself: **what steps do citizens have to take to reach the final objective of the service?** To answer this question, it can be useful to outline the steps citizens must take to reach the defined objective. To do so, we recommend using the model [user journey outline](https://designers.italia.it/kit/esperienza-utente/).

For example, as regards the TARI (tax on waste) service, the essential steps can be as follows:

1. a citizen prepares a declaration of occupation;
2. the institution receives the declaration of occupation;
3. the institution confirms to the citizen that the declaration was received;
4. the institution sends the pagoPA notification to the citizen;
5. the citizen selects how to pay the notification;
6. the institution receives the amount due.
