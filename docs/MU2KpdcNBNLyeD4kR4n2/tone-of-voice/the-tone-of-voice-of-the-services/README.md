# The tone of voice of the services

The text used on the interfaces for the digital products **plays an important role** in the user experience. For this reason, IO wants to communicate in a clear, informal and inclusive manner.

This is a very broad topic, but here are a few rules to follow for effective communication:

* **You don’t need a lot of words**  
To design a good user experience, you must get straight to the point of what you want to communicate. It is important to not write things that the users could already know and add too many details if they can distract from the ultimate purpose of the message and the screen in question.
* **Chose what to say and when to say it**  
Information must be given in the right place at the right moment: based on these two factors, the information will be more or less useful for users. We recommend providing general information on the pages that present the service, and more specific information – such as related to the tools and methods of use – in messages.
* **The text must inform and guide the action**  
Each text must lead users to perform an action, such as saving a reminder, making a payment or searching for more information. We recommend clear instructions and calls to action to avoid creating dead ends for the user.
