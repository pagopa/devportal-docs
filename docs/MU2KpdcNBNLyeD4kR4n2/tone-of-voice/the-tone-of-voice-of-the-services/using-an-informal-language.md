# Use informal language

The IO app uses language that brings the user closer to the public administration. For this reason, use everyday language without trivializing the complexities and explain possible technical terms. Here are some suggestions for writing content using a language that is closer to the citizens:

**Use an informal tone**

Use an informal tone and avoid formal expressions.

**Use everyday words**

Do not use bureaucratic or technical terms: search for an everyday equivalent. If this is not possible, always explain what it means.

#### Use an active voice

Prefer an active voice over a passive voice.

**Do not use directional language**

Do not use spacial references such as “up”, “down”, “right”, “left".

**Do not use emojis**

Their meaning could be ambiguous.
