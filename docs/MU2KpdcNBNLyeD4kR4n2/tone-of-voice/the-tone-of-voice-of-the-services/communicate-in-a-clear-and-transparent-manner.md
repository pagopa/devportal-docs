# Communicate in a clear and transparent manner

Here are some suggestions for writing content that is clear and transparent for citizens:

**One phrase, one concept**

Avoid information overloads, but give the possibility to learn more. A phrase must express only one concept. Writing in this way, texts will be easier to understand and follow a logical and clear pattern.

**Noun, verb, complement**

Always follow the structure subject, verb and complement. Avoid subordinates and asides.

**Use the pyramid rule**

When you have to structure complex content, first enter the essential information. Then go always into more detail.

**Use adjectives and adverbs sparingly**

Adjectives and adverbs lengthen phrases: use them only if they truly add value.

**Use affirmations and not negations**

Where possible, transform negative phrases into positive ones: often the negation can be confusing.

**Always explain acronyms**

If acronyms are used, explain them always between parenthesis. For example, "CIE (Electronic Identity Card) or SUE (Single Information Point for Construction).
