# Contacts and information

The bottom of the service tab indicates the contacts the users can use to **receive more information regarding the service or to request assistance**. 

In this case, you must ask yourself:

* if there is a dedicated and official website where more information is provided about the service? 
* if there is an email, telephone number or chat to which the citizen can be directed if there are problems with the service?

In the mandatory contacts indicate the **web address** that the users can access to consult the privacy policy for the service. We also recommend indicating **at least one contact for support** for each service.

In addition, also the following can be indicated:

* the **web address** where the institution provides the **service** itself or provides more information;
* the link to an **app** the institution provides on Apple Store and Google Play to offer the same function or same service offered with IO; 
*  the **web address** the users can access to consult the **terms and conditions** of the service, if available.

**A showcase of the essential services**

IO can be an optimal showcase of the digital services already provided by the institution and help it inform users of the website and the apps that already exist. The service tab can also be reached from the messages sent by the service.
