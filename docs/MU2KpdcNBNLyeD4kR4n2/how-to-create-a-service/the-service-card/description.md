# Description

On IO, each service has a details tab that contains a description. This tab must contain the following information: **what does this service provide? who is it for? what does this service do via IO?**

#### **The description of a service must:**

* explain in detail what the service does;
* clarify who it is for, if there are requirements;
* be comprised of brief phrases, using everyday language and common words;
* not include acronyms;
* address citizens using informal language. 

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✅ A correct service description" %}
**`Electronic Identity Card`**

`This service concerns the request, issue and expiration of your Electronic Identity Card.`

`With IO you can:`

* `request an appointment to have your Identity Card issued or replaced;`
* `receive a reminder for your appointment;`
* `pay the amount due for the issue of your card;`
* `receive a message that informs you of the expiration of the card;`
* `receive information and additional communications.`

**In this case:**

✅ the text is brief and clear;

✅ it does not contain grammatical errors;

✅ it directly addresses the recipient in an informal manner;

✅ it provides a detailed explanation of what can be done with IO.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="❌ A service description to improve" %}
**`Identity card expiration'`**

`The registry office service - notification of identification card expiration keeps you updated about the state of your documents. With IO you can: \- receive a reminder close to the expiration date of your identity card.`

**In this case:**

❌ both the name of the service and the description contain grammatical errors;

❌ the first phrase does not clearly explain what it is about: what is meant with “state of the documents"? What state? Which documents?

❌ the service is too narrow: it should be called “Identity card” and be used to send not only communications regarding expiration, but any communication regarding this document (payment of fees, appointment, information of documents to bring with you...).
