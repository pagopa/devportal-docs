# The channels

If an institution creates services on IO for the first time, adds a new service or expands the uses and functions of an existing service, letting citizens know about this means **generating awareness**. Invite them to download the IO app if they have not already done so.

Usually the **channels available to an institution are**:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="ðŸ“±Digital" %}
message on IO, the institutional website, newsletters, press releases, social media of the institution or its members, channels in instant messaging apps, online media.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title=" ðŸ“© Analog" %}
municipal notice board, events, fliers, billboards, printed media (local press), press conferences.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

This section provides information about **which channels** to use to inform citizens of news and updates regarding the services of the institution provided on IO. In general, in order to select which channels to use, it can be useful to answer these questions first: 

* which **group of people** uses this service? 
* among the channels available to the institution, which are those **most used** by this group of people?
* how **important** is this information? How much **interest** should it generate?
