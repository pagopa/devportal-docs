# Important deadlines

There are services that have **deadlines** for all citizens: taxes such as TARI (tax on waste) have deadlines that are the same for everyone, as well as school registration or the date by which a bonus can be requested. These occasions can be used on a communication level to:

* **inform citizens** about a certain deadline;
* **remind** them that the service is available on IO, encouraging them to download and use the app.

In this case, we suggest:

1. **sending a message on IO to recipients** that communicates the deadline. In the case of payment, we suggest also including the relative notification;
2. **add a banner or communication** about the deadline on the institutional website in the area of interest, for example "Taxes" or "Education";
3. send a **press release** to local or national media;
4. **make targeted campaigns** depending on the public, for example affixing advertisements in front of schools, in the case of a scholastic deadline.
