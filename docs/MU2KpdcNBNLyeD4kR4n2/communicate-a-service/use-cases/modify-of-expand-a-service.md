# Modify or expand a service

When the institution changes a service on IO by expanding its uses and functions, it can be communicated only if the change is **particularly important and meaningful**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**An example**

The "day care" service of the municipality, which previously only communicated the registration period on IO, now also sends payment notifications for the fees to be paid and sends messages about the state of the request and publication of the ranking.
{% endhint %}

In this case, we suggest:

1. **write a news article** and publish it on the institution's website, in the relative section if possible (e.g. communication of the start of registration for day care in the “School” section of the website);
2. **post on the digital channels** on institutional and social media channels to launch the news. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Does the change concern a service that has an impact on the entire national territory?**

In this case, we recommend also sending a message via IO to users who interacted at least once with this service to inform them of what has changed.
