# Malfunctions, technical problems and errors

If there are errors in a message, we recommend referring to section [what to do in case of a sending error](../../che-cosa-puo-fare-un-servizio-su-io/cosa-fare-in-caso-di-errori-nellinvio/ "mention"), which includes some message templates to customize and use depending on the type of error.

In the case of **malfunctions and large and ongoing technical problems** that have a strong impact on the provision of the service, we suggest informing citizens through the institutional channels available to the institution, such as press releases or social media.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**It is necessary to explain the type of malfunction and how long it will last**

In these communications, it is important to explain what the malfunction is and how long it will last, what are the impacts on citizens and if there are alternative channels to use until the problem is solved. Once the malfunction is solved, use the same channels to communicate it.
{% endhint %}

If the problem was caused by a technological partner or the aggregator, the press release and posts in digital channels must always be made **in the name of the institution**. In the same way, PagoPA S.p.A. or the IO app must not be blamed for problems or malfunctions for which the institution or technological partner is responsible.
