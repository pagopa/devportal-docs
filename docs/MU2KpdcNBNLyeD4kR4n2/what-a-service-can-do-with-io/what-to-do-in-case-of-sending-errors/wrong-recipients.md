# Wrong recipients

Also in this case, before sending a message we suggest to **always check that the list of recipients is correct**. If a message is still sent to incorrect recipients, we suggest sending another message correcting the error based on this template:

**`Title:`**` ``Error correction + title of the incorrect message`

**`Text of the message`**`:`

`Hello,`

`We are writing you to inform you that the message with the title`` `**`[title of the message]`**` ``was sent to you in error. Therefore please ignore its content`` `**`[, including the attached notification of payment]`**`.`

`We are sorry for the inconvenience.`

{% hint style="info" %}
Any questions? Before sending an error correction message **contact IO support** by sending an email to [onboarding@io.italia.it](mailto:onboarding@io.italia.it).
