## Payments

For messages conveying a payment request, there are a few tips to keep in mind.

Whether it has a <mark style="color:blue;">**generic** </mark> or a <mark style="color:blue;">**specific description**</mark>, the Institution must correctly inform the citizen about the source of his or her overdue amount (e.g. traffic ticket no., appointment booking no., etc.). 

An example of a <mark style="color:blue;">**specific description**</mark>**:** 

When the payment is linked to a **direct debit**— including in the bank, on a current account, RID (Direct Interbank Ratios)-available only in certain cases, the object of the regular debits (e.g., tuition, bills, subscriptions,...) should be specified in the payment description.

## Payment confirmation 

❌  A payment confirmation template has not been provided because when a citizen makes a payment to an institution via pagoPA, he/she automatically receives the outcome of the transaction in the IO app. On the other hand, for a payment receipt, which releases the citizen from his or her obligation to pay according to the law, they will always have to contact the Creditor.
