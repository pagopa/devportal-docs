# The most frequent service models

The most frequent [**service models**](https://docs.pagopa.it/i-modelli-dei-servizi) are **templates the Institution can start from to configure the services on IO.** Specifically, these messages can be useful for:

* **defining the list of services** that the institution wants to offer with IO;
* **defining the series of messages** that each service sends to users and when they are sent;
* preparing the information necessary for **preparing the service tab**; 
* **creating a coherent experience**.

Each model contains the name of the service, the description, a thematic topic, the message texts and the relative moments when they must be sent.
