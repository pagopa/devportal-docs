# Informing citizens

## Why do it through IO?

1. You can easily reach millions of citizens;
2. You have a universal address available: all you need to know is the recipient's fiscal code;
3. You have a qualified channel where you can send relevant communications, including via push notifications or email forwarding;
4. You can easily send payment requests, attach files, or promote external resources (e.g., "Go to the website" button);
5. You don't have to worry about managing subscriptions\\unsubscriptions: citizens can do this independently in the app.

## What tools do you have available?

The following functions can be used to inform citizens with IO:
