# Sending legally binding communications

The [Digital Notification Service (SEND)](https://notifichedigitali.pagopa.it/) digitalizes and simplifies the **management of legally binding communications** and is integrated with the IO app. This allows users to receive legally binding communications and pay any expenses directly in-app.

### **How does it work?**

1. **The institution creates the notification request**

With the use of an API Key or manually, the institution creates the notification request and uploads the attachments.

2. **The platform takes charge of it**

SEND, Digital Notification Service performs the technical checks if the requirements specified in the technical manual are satisfied, it takes on the notification. Each time the status changes, the relative certification that is enforceable against third parties is generated.

3. **The notification is sent**

The platform uses the various channels available to inform the user of the presence of a notification: PEC (certified email), IO app, e-mail, SMS. If the digital transmission attempts are not successful, the notification will be sent in paper form

4. **The recipient receives it**

If the recipient accesses the platform, they can download the notified documents and at the same time pay what is due thanks to integration with pagoPA. If the recipient receives it via IO, they can proceed directly in the app.
