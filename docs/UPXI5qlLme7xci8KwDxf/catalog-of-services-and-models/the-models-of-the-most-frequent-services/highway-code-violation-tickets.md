# Fines for traffic code violations

Providing the service "Fines for traffic code violations" via IO makes it possible for institutions to:

* **update citizens in real time** and therefore allow them to pay for the traffic code violations on time;
* **reduce the times** and costs for the process of notification and delivery of the fine;
* **speed up the times** for collecting the fines;
* **inform of expiring notifications**, reducing the possibility for citizens to have to pay additional fines.

**A model to be customized**

The procedures for this service vary greatly among institutions. We recommend using the message texts as a starting point and adding additional information. 

The model is an example that is not binding for the institution and for which the Company does not accept any liability, as it serves only as an example.

You can copy the messages to be customized from [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UHvSOKM6SDvGh5tU2VRrLLOx7GNv-4TlVJKH_PTthDQ/edit#gid=538647580).
