Some of these functions, such as read reminders and talking push notifications, may require expressed consent by users to be activated.

**The advantages of IO:**

* millions of people can be reached, therefore savings are achieved by no longer sending paper communications; 
* universal address: only the recipient's tax code must be known; 
* the message have “added value” (_call to action_, etc.); 
* users can receive push notifications and activate the forwarding of messages they receive in-app to their email;
* the sending institution is always qualified and the user can decide who can contact them.
