# 4⃣ What happens on IO?

To be offered on IO, a service must not necessarily be 100% digital: it can be partially digital.

**An example**

The TARI (tax on waste) service can be completely digital and convey on IO all the points of the process that make up the service, from the declaration of occupation request up to payment. But it could only to have the payment made on IO.
{% endhint %}

For this reason, when a service is defined, it is important to analyze **in which points of the process IO can be integrated, and how**. In the case of TARI, for example, IO can:

* send an informational message to remind the recipients that it is time to prepare the declaration of occupation, if they must do so;
* send one or more messages about the state of the occupation request;
* send a message with a payment notification;
* send a reminder near the deadline for a payment.
