# 1⃣ What is the objective of the service?

To define a service to be integrated in IO, we recommend starting with this question: **what is the benefit citizens obtain from this service?** It is not necessary to think about how the institution sees the service, but how the citizens see it: don't think about the type of procedure, but what the people obtain.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title=" ✅ Objectives for citizens" %}
Receive a copy of the birth certificate for their daughter, obtain a request for citizenship, renew the electronic identity card.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="❌ Objectives for institutions" %}
Pay the fees upon expiration of the identity card, open a 5672 procedure, collect an amount.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**The service models**

[This section](../../catalogo-dei-servizi-e-modelli/i-modelli-dei-servizi-piu-frequenti/) contains the models for the most frequent services: before creating one from scratch, check if there is a model already ready to be used.
{% endhint %}

### One service, various functions and types of communications

A service **can contain one or more functions**, depending on its type and how it is offered by the institution through digital channels. 

A service **never coincides with a single function or type of communication**: therefore it is not correct to create different services for different functions or types of communication. This prevents the multiplication of services that perform only one function, in favor of more complex services, resulting in greater value perceived by citizens. 

#### An example

Let’s imagine that the municipality of Ipazia joins IO with the “day care” service dedicated to residents in the municipality who are also the parents of preschool age children.

This service sends **two types of communications**: it informs the parents that registration is open for day care and sends a payment notification to those who already registered their child.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✅ It is correct to do this" %}
The municipality of Ipazia creates a service called "**Day care**". 

The service can:

* send recipients a message that informs them that day care registration is open and that contains the link to the website where the registration can be made;
* at the end of the registration process using channels other than IO, send a message to the parents who already registered their child with the notification for payment, which can be paid directly in-app.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="❌ It is incorrect to do this" %}
The municipality of Ipazia creates two services called "**Day care registration**" and "**Day care registration payment**". 

The "**Day care registration**" service can:

* Send recipients a message that informs them that day care registration is open and that contains the link to the website where the registration can be made;

The "**Day care registration payment**" service can:

* at the end of the registration process using channels other than IO, send a message to the parents who already registered their child with the notification for payment, which can be paid directly in-app.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### A new service and services already published

If you want to publish a new service, it is important to make sure that it is not an extension or evolution of an already existing service.

**An example**

The municipality of Ipazia has three published services: "Tax on waste (TARI)", "Electronic Identity Card" (CIE) and "Cemetery services". 

Later it decides to publish two new services: "Votive lights” and “Civic museums". 

❌ If the municipality would decide to publish the “Votive lights” service, this would not be correct and would not be approved: the payment of the votive lights must be included with the “Cemetery services” service. 

✅ If instead the municipality realizes this overlap, it would decide to change the description of “Cemetery services” and not publish a new service.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each time you want to create a new service, go to the list of services already published by your institution and make sure there are no overlaps, even partially.
