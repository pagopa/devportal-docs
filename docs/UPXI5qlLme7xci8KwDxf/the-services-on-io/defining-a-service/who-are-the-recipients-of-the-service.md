# 2⃣ Who uses the service?

The second step is to define **who are the recipients of the service** in question: they can be, for example, the residents of a certain municipality or region, or citizens within a certain age range or with a certain ISEE (Equivalent Economic Situation Indicator). 

Identifying who the people are who benefit from a service is important, as it could influence **the channels and methods** used to provide it. **In the case of IO, it is even more important**, because an institution can send messages only to tax codes it already has.

IO **does not share** the tax codes of users who downloaded the app with institutions.
