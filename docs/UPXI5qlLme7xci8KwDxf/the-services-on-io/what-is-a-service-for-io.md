# What is a service for IO

A service provided with IO is the **digital version** **or extension of an already digitalized service** provided by an institution – public, private, central or local – and targeted toward one or more groups of citizens.

A service is defined by: 

* [X] an **objective** – for example, registrations, reminders, payments, information, certificates and subsidies;
* [X] a **reference public** – for example all citizens characterized by specific attributes such as age, profession or residency;
* [X] a **provider** of the service; 
* [X] a **level of interactivity** with the recipients – for example unidirectional ([informational messages](../what-a-service-can-do-with-io/sending-messages/informational-messages.md)) or bidirectional ([payment messages](../che-cosa-puo-fare-un-servizio-su-io/inviare-messaggi/messaggi-che-veicolano-un-pagamento/)); 
* [X] a **topic** – such as "Registry and civic services", "Education and training", "Working life", "Free time and sport"; 
* [X] a **geographic area of authority** – for example, the entire national territory, the municipality, the region.

**A service on IO is valid if its objective can be reached:**

* in the app;
* using the channels of the institute that provides it, which can be reached from the app via a link.  

## Some clarifications about services and messages conveyed on IO

❌ **A service does not coincide with the message or type of message that the institution sends to citizens**  
It is incorrect to create a separate service for each message or category of communication to be sent. A service can be complex and can involve the sending of various messages - informational, for payment, reminders - or generate different situations - make a payment, proceed with a registration- depending on its nature.

**❌ IO is not a channel for sending messages of little use to or that are confusing for citizens**  
Services must have a precise objective that gives a perception of utility. To learn more about this topic, read the additional terms for the function “basic and fast messages” container in the [standard contract](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/KXYtsf32WSKm6ga638R3/s/O7clRJB6pY0VI5sEBF8J/).

The standard contract is the contract that every institution must sign in order to provide their services with IO.

**❌ Communications may not be generic. They must, on the contrary, be as detailed and targeted as possible**  
For example, a message that informs a person that something happened on another channel must at least indicate what happened and provide a link for more information.

**Personal communications**

IO is a platform for communications and services **that are relevant for the individual**. This means that interaction must take place only when the institution must send a communication or solve a problem relevant for that specific recipient. 

The same message can be sent to multiple recipients, providing that it is relevant for each of them and cannot be considered an undesired message (spam).
