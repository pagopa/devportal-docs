# Test message sent to citizens

When sending a test message, make sure to follow the [information in the technical guide](http://127.0.0.1:5000/s/coSKRte21UjDBRWKLtEs/funzionalita/inviare-un-messaggio/messaggi-di-test), to prevent errors when sending it.

If a test message is still sent to citizens, we suggest sending another message correcting the error based on this template:

**`Title:`**`Message sent by mistake`

**`Text of the message`**`:`

`Hello,`

`We are writing you to inform you that the message with the title`` `**`[title of the message]`**` ``was sent to you in error. Therefore please ignore its content`` `**`[, including the attached notification of payment]`**`.`

`We are sorry for the inconvenience.`

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**

Regardless of the type of error, if it was caused by a technological partner or by the aggregator, **the message must always be in the name of the institution sending the original message**: citizens do not know the technological partners and this could create further confusion for them.
{% endhint %}

Any questions? Before sending an error correction message **contact IO support** by sending an email to [onboarding@io.italia.it](mailto:onboarding@io.italia.it).
