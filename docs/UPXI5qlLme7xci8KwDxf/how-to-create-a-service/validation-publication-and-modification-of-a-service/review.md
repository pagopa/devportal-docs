# Review

The created services are sent for a review process that guarantees their quality. Therefore they can be published only if considered valid, that is if they **respect the technical and content requirements** indicated in this operating manual. 

**A service will not be approved, for example, if:**

<details>

<summary>The description is not meaningful</summary>

If the service has a title and description that are not correlated, or a description that is not meaningful, it will not be approved.

❌ An example of what not to do:

 `TARI"” (tax on waste)

`The service allows citizens to receive updates about the activities carried out by the municipality.`

</details>

<details>

<summary>The service is a duplicate</summary>

If the service coincides partially or fully with another service of the institution already published on IO, it will not be approved.

❌ The same institution cannot indicate on IO two different services that concern TARI, such as “Issue of TARI payment` and `TARI payment deadline notification`

</details>

<details>

<summary>The links are not precise or meaningful</summary>

Some services are indicated on IO only to provide a link to access an external site. If the link is to an informational or generic page, and not a page for users to perform a precise action, the service will not be approved.

❌ An example of what not to do:

`Museum tickets`

`The service makes it possible to purchase tickets for the town museum.`

`Visit the website`

In this case, the link on “Visit the website” opens the “Payments and collections” page of the service provider. To be approved, the service must directly open the page for purchasing the tickets.
