# Validation, publication and modification of a service

To create a service, it is necessary to access the IO back office (from the developer portal or reserved area) and use the interface or integration via API. In any case, the **service tab must be completed** and **activation must be carried out**. 

To discover how to do this, [<mark style="color:blue;">**go to the technical guide -->**</mark> ](https://docs.pagopa.it/io-guida-tecnica/?)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**The Developer Portal will be discontinued**

The [Developer Portal](https://developer.io.italia.it/) is still functioning, but will be discontinued over the next months in favor of the back office that can be accessed from the **[Reserved Area](https://www.pagopa.it/it/self-care/). The porting process will be gradual and institutions will have all the time they need to switch to the new portal.
