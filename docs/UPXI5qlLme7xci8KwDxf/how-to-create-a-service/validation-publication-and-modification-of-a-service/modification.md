# Modification

The institution can **modify a service tab** at any time, regardless if it is a draft or published on the app. 

The service is validated again after being modified in order to guarantee its quality.

At the moment, the back office **does not allow permanently deleting** a service. We recommend institutions to leave the service tab of the service they want to delete in the “draft” state and add the prefix **\[DELETED]** to the name.
