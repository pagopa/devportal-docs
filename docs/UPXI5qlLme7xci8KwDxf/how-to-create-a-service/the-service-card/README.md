# The service tab

IO contains more than 230,000 services provided by more than 15,000 institutions (number updated as of September 2023). Services are divided into **local** and **national** and shown in the Services section, where they can be searched by the name of the institution offering them.

Each institution has the services it offers on IO below its name. By touching a single service, a dedicated tab appears on which the user can find this information:

* [**the name of the service**](name-of-the-service.md);
* [**the description**](description.md), that clearly explains the purpose of the service;
* the service [**logo**](logo.md), which is optional;
* a series of service **attributes**, such as the [**contacts**](../../appendix/contacts.md) for requesting assistance and the **privacy policy** related to the processing of personal data by the service provider.

**The importance of the service tab**

The information contained on the tab of a service is used to inform the users of **what they can expect when using it**, in order to help them decide whether to activate or deactivate it, and give them the **opportunity to communicate** **with the institution**. For this reason, it is very important to follow the indications in the next sections.
